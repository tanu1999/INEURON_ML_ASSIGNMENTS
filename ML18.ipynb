    "Ans: The main distinction between the two approaches is the use of labeled datasets. To put it simply, supervised learning uses labeled input and output data, while an unsupervised learning algorithm does not.

    "Ans: The various types of clustering are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Connectivity-based Clustering (Hierarchical clustering): Hierarchical Clustering is a method of unsupervised machine learning clustering where it begins with a pre-defined top to bottom hierarchy of clusters. It then proceeds to perform a decomposition of the data objects based on this hierarchy, hence obtaining the clusters. This method follows two approaches based on the direction of progress, i.e., whether it is the top-down or bottom-up flow of creating clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Centroids-based Clustering (Partitioning methods): Centroid based clustering is considered as one of the most simplest clustering algorithms, yet the most effective way of creating clusters and assigning data points to it. The intuition behind centroid based clustering is that a cluster is characterized and represented by a central vector and data points that are in close proximity to these vectors are assigned to the respective clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Density-based Clustering (Model-based methods): If one looks into the previous two methods that we discussed, one would observe that both hierarchical and centroid based algorithms are dependent on a distance (similarity/proximity) metric. The very definition of a cluster is based on this metric. Density-based clustering methods take density into consideration instead of distances. Clusters are considered as the densest region in a data space, which is separated by regions of lower object density and it is defined as a maximal-set of connected points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distribution-based Clustering: Until now, the clustering techniques as we know are based around either proximity (similarity/distance) or composition (density). There is a family of clustering algorithms that take a totally different metric into consideration – probability. Distribution-based clustering creates and groups data points based on their likely hood of belonging to the same probability distribution (Gaussian, Binomial etc.) in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fuzzy Clustering: The general idea about clustering revolves around assigning data points to mutually exclusive clusters, meaning, a data point always resides uniquely inside a cluster and it cannot belong to more than one cluster. Fuzzy clustering methods change this paradigm by assigning a data-point to multiple clusters with a quantified degree of belongingness metric. The data-points that are in proximity to the center of a cluster, may also belong in the cluster that is at a higher degree than points in the edge of a cluster. The possibility of which an element belongs to a given cluster is measured by membership coefficient that vary from 0 to 1."
